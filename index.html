                <h3>Self-Checkout Machines</h3>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> This project aims to identify key UX challenges in self-checkout kiosks
                    by analyzing real-world user interactions. The focus is on understanding common pain points such as
                    bagging area errors, slow touchscreen responsiveness, and the need for manual store assistance when
                    purchasing restricted items.</li>

                <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> The study involved conducting on-site observations and unbiased
                    interviews with users actively interacting with self-checkout machines. The process included
                    developing structured, neutral interview questions to gather insights into user expectations,
                    experiences, and frustrations. These findings were then synthesized into user personas and a
                    storyboard to visualize the user journey.</li>

                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The project resulted in the creation of detailed user personas
                    representing different types of self-checkout users, such as the efficient/younger shopper and the
                    careful, methodical middle-aged user. Additionally, a storyboard was developed to illustrate the
                    self-checkout experience, highlighting both seamless interactions and moments of user frustration.
                    These insights can be used to improve self-checkout kiosk design for a more user-friendly and
                    efficient experience.</li>

                        lines.</li>
                    <li>Some users required assistance for at least one aspect, such as barcode issues or restricted
